# SkyBook

SkyBook is a simple flight logbook mobile app built with React Native. It lets you quickly record flights and keep notes about each one. This is an MVP designed to work offline using AsyncStorage for persistence.

## Features

- Add flights with date, aircraft, duration and optional notes
- View a list of all recorded flights
- Data is stored locally on the device

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This uses Expo so you can run the app on an emulator or your mobile device.

Since this repository does not include compiled dependencies, you will need to install them via `npm install` before running the app.
